# AGENTS.md

Operating contract for agents working in **Diopsis** — a Storybook visual-regression tool.

## What this repo is

A tool that screenshots a **built static Storybook** and diffs each story against baselines
committed in the consuming repository. No hosted service, no uploads. The v1 design and
every decision behind it live in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

Layout:

- `src/` — the engine. `cli.ts` dispatches, `config.ts` finds and resolves configuration,
  `story-index.ts` parses Storybook's index, `matrix.ts` expands stories into captures,
  `server.ts` serves the build, and `reporter.ts` is the Playwright reporter that owns the
  review surface. `commands/` holds one file per CLI command, `runner/` generates and runs
  the Playwright project, `runtime/` holds the code the generated spec imports, and
  `report/` classifies results and renders the self-contained HTML report.
- `test/` — `node --test` suites, plus a Storybook-shaped fixture under `test/fixtures/` that
  needs no Storybook install.
- `scripts/` — checks wired into one specific moment rather than into `npm test`.
  `report-check.mjs` renders a report from a synthetic run and drives it in a real browser,
  because the report's behaviour is client-side JavaScript that the unit suite can only assert
  was emitted. It runs on demand via `npm run check:report`, and `.githooks/pre-commit.local`
  runs it only when `src/report/` is staged — no other commit should pay for launching a
  browser.

`npm run build` compiles to `dist/`; `npm test` typechecks and runs the suites. End-to-end
validation runs against a real Storybook build that is reproduced locally and never
committed — see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) D-013.

## This is a public repository

Everything committed here is permanent and world-readable once published — history
included, not just the current tree. Before writing anything, know these rules:

- **No environment or machine detail.** No absolute paths, hostnames, OS/tool versions of
  the author's setup, or local configuration.
- **No employer or client context.** No organization names, internal project names, ticket
  identifiers, internal URLs, registries or CI images.
- **No identity or account configuration.** Author metadata belongs in `LICENSE` and
  `package.json` — never git identity rules, credentials or publishing mechanics in prose.
- **No other projects.** This repo knows only about itself.
- **No competitive positioning.** Describe what Diopsis does and why that matters. Naming
  another tool is acceptable only as a neutral, verifiable interop fact — never as
  comparison or market analysis.
- **No internal deliberation.** No provenance of where the idea came from, no "as
  discussed", no second person aimed at the author, no metrics measured on a private
  codebase.

The test for any line: *would this make sense, and be safe, read by a stranger who knows
nothing about the author, their employer, or their other work?*

## Where things go

One home per fact; the others link to it.

- **README.md** — what this is, why use it, how to start. Written for a user.
- **DECISIONS.md** — why it is the way it is, and what was ruled out. Written for a future
  maintainer. The *decision* to defer something is recorded here.
- **ROADMAP.md** — the living what's-next list, freely pruned and reordered; the README
  carries a one-line pointer to it, never the list (D-018).
- Never restate a decision's rationale in the README; state the outcome and link.

**The README keeps a fixed reading order** — problem in the reader's words → what it does →
visible proof → constraints → fastest path to value → depth → reference → meta — with
section names left free. Nothing enforces it; it is a checklist, not a gate. The parts that
are not negotiable: a centred header block with the logo and badges, an SVG logo committed
alongside its rendered PNG (both under `media/`), every image and repo-file link an absolute
URL (npm renders the README without resolving relative paths), the project name capitalised
in prose but lowercase as an identifier (`Diopsis compares` but `npx diopsis run`), the
problem stated before the solution, real output shown within the first screen — captured
from a run, never sketched — constraints before Install, commands living in exactly one
section, and `## License` closing the file.

## The decision record

`DECISIONS.md` carries `<!-- decisions-format: 1 -->`, so every entry is format-checked.

- Entries are `## D-NNN — YYYY-MM-DD — title`, numbered from D-001, never renumbered.
- Every entry carries a **`Scope:`** line. This is enforced, not customary.
- **Append-only:** never edit an entry's substance. Correct it by superseding it with a new
  entry that names what it replaces. Typos and dead links may be fixed in place.
- Entries must be self-contained — no references to conversations or people.

## Done =

- `etymd audit` clean.
- No banned content (above) in any tracked file, including commit messages.
